# trm_farming_redo
This is a treasure registration mod for treasurer [trm_farming_redo] (named trm_farming_redo so it doesn't interfere with trm_farming from trmp_minetest_game)


This mod ONLY works for TenPlus1's farming redo [farming] not minetest_game [farming], where trmp_minetest_game should be used instead of this mod. This mod is meant to be used alongside trmp_minetest_game, but only when you have farming redo.
