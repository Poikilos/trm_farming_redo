# trm_farming_redo
This is a treasure registration mod for treasurer [trm_farming_redo] (named trm_farming_redo so it doesn't interfere with trm_farming from trmp_minetest_game)


This mod ONLY works for TenPlus1's farming redo [farming] **(if you are using minetest_game [farming], trmp_minetest_game should be used instead of this mod)**. This mod is meant to be used alongside trmp_minetest_game, but only when you have farming redo. In addition, if trm_farming (part of trmp_minetest_game) is not installed, this mod will detect that and register those treasures (items that are present in both TenPlus1's farming redo and minetest_game's farming).
